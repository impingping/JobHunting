**Q:What is Binary Search Tree?, feature of it?**

**A:**BST keeps its order in its structure. For example, a typical BST is: left child < parent; right child > parent. 
In this way, search operation is O(logn) which is faster than O(n), however still slow than hash table with O(1). 

**Q:What is Least Common Ancestor for a Binary Tree?**

**A:**First, Binary Tree is NOT a Binary Search Tree; 

Second, Let T be a rooted tree. The lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined as the lowest node in T that has both n1 and n2 as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).
