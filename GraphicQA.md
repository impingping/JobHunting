**Q:What is topological sorting? And what is DFS(depth-first-traversal)**  
**A:** In **DFS**, we print a vertex and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices. DFS of a graph is similar to that 
of DFS of a tree,  differeciating in that in graph we may visit the same vertex a couple times if there is circle iin the graph.   
In **topological sorting**, we need to print a vertex before its adjacent vertices.
