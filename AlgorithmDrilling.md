**How to Solve a problem Quick**

1. Understand the question, better visualize the question.  
2. What type of data structure fit/assist to solve the problem? ArrayList, Queue, Stack?   
3. Pay attention to nameing convention.  
4. Contrive sound test cases.  

**What is D&C algorithm?**

**A:**D&C refers to Divide&Conquer. A divide and conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.
