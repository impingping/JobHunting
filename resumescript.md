# Drilling Interview 
### 6-year industrial experience in Embedded System design 
1.1, Talk about your past work experience, and the achievement. 

completed more than 5 products from scratch; crystal clear about each phrase of product design.

1.2, What is your daily routine during the work? 

We have a weekly cycle which is built upon a monthly plan. Each week there will be a brief review for the past week, and follows a very important part about what to conduct in the following week. Then the daily routine will serve that goal. 
Being a leader in the team, things are more complex: 1)push my own part forward; 2)make sure other members can contribute to the project;3)arrange resources for the whole team and get rid of unnecessary schedules. In essence there is priority for these dos and donâ€™ts. And I will make sure we act the same.  

2, Why do you transfer from an Embedded System engineer to a Java developer/software engineer?

From a broad viewpoint, I do transfer from another industry into the Internet Industry. 

And I believe it is much more challenge to be a software engineer. For me, they have a lot in common: both project-oriented, both making the best out of the hardware; Both have to conduct project management. 
Basically, it is all about manipulating data: How to collect data, how to apply algorithms to data, how to present data to consumers.

When concerning about the programming language, Java is syntactically similar to C which makes it easy for a C programmer to understand the Java code without much effort.  

To sum up, most of my working experience can implant for my new position seamlessly. 

2.1 What is your career plan for the next 5 years?

It is a great question. 

Mainly two phrases: a software engineer and then a software Architect.

  1. During training period, have a full picture for the specific project I take part in and master any domain specific language/convention, build up friendship with team members. 
  2. For a junior engineer, deliver the tasks independently, which I believe will be easy based on my past work experience.  And learn from the senior engineer/product managers about the art of management and communication. Pick up a domain and try to be the second to none in this area, which I think will help the whole team sooner or later.
  3. Senior engineer: with great power comes great responsibility. I would like to take more responsibility to the project and pass on my knowledge to whoever needed.
  4. Lead software engineer
  5. Development Manager. 
  6. Associate Architect/ Architect/Senior Architect/VP Software Development.


### Hands-on experience with implementing file system driver in C
* what type of file system driver do you implement?

FAT32. 

* How do you think the relationship between an OS and a file system?

File system is about the organization of data. 
OS is about how the computer conducts tasks from a user or an application, and it isolates the application with the hardware. 
They are independent of each other. 
* How do the file systems manage a file? 

File systems use metadata to store and retrieve files. Metadata includes:file name, file size; file format; file created date/modified date. 
 
### Strong knowledge of C/Java programming on Android OS 
1, What type of project/research have you done on Android? 

My graduate thesis is to build a health-data management system which has a server built up XAMPP, which is a peer of LAMP; an Android app that collects blue-tooth device data and display the data to users, at the same time transfer data to server. 


### Familiar with Linux/Android Kernel 
1. Talk about Linux directory layout. 
Linux manages files with two sets of properties: static and variable, sharable and un-sharable. 
2. How does Linux handle inter-process communication.
The Linux IPC facilities provide a method for multiple processes to communicate with one another. There are several methods of IPC available to Linux C programmers. 
  * Half-duplex UNIX pipes.
  * FIFOs(named pipes)
  * SYSV style message queues.
  * SYSV style semaphore sets.
  * SYSV style shared memeory segments
  * Networking sockets
  * Full-duplex pipes(STREAMS pipes)

### Deep understanding of OOP and basic design patterns 
1. Talk about what is OOP.
It is rooted at the concept of Object, which contains data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. 
Two features of Java is: encapsulation and multiple inheritance from interfaces. 
2. What type of design patterns are you familiar with?
Single Design Pattern; Builder Pattern; Proxy design Pattern; Observer Design Pattern.
3. How to implement a Singleton Design Pattern.
  * Static final field member that holds a instance of itself. 
  * Private constructor, which ensures only a single instance of the class can be instantiated. 

### Experience as a leader to manage a team 
1. What is the size of the team? How do you manage a team? 

### Miscs: 
* Talk about yourself.

My engineering mindset is: everything has a solution, which is what I apply for my 6-year working experience on embedded system design. And I enjoy my most recent product design experience, which I have opportunity not only to upgrade my technical skill sets and also have a very close connecting with people. Together whole team delivered the products within 9 months, while its predecessor took almost 2 years.
My strength is my ability to work under high pressure and making products meeting deadline. When I commit to doing something, I make sure it not only go through, but have better outcome. 
What I am looking for now is a company where I can be a part of the team, and also focus my energy on my best strength, I would like to build a long term career that lets me focus on professional growth.  

### Asking myself
1. Which two parts would you like to impress the interviewers? 

  * Algorithms and ability to express it in Java.
  * Understanding about Java ecosystem, not in the broad way, but in depth which means whatever I claim I understand, I get it 80% or more. 
2. Which example do you think of can achieve the aforementioned effect? 
For Java, I can talk about the HashMap and its related questions. 
For algorithms, try best to impress with run-time complexity and efficiency, and good coding habit (naming convention, clearly express the algorithms).

### Do you have any questions about our company? / or the position? 
1. How many people are in this group? 
2. Whom does the position in this position report to?
3. How does the leader organize the whole team? 
4. What is the biggest challenge in this job? 
5. How long the whole team have been set up? And why this position is open now?
6. What do you enjoy most about working in this company?
7. How fast does the company grow in the last 5 years?
